# Welcome to A Java Guideline!

Hi there! The aim of this project is to create a recopilation of well known practices when coding in OOP. Most of it's cases should be agnostic to the programing language, bit in orer to keep it as close as possible to reality we're gonna try and stay with Java examples.
Please notice that the goal of the code produced following these techniques is to be Readable, Upgradable and Mantainable (RUM) while, obviously, making it do what it's expected to do. While performance is pretty important, it's, normally, not the most important when choosing to build a Java application, because, you know... byte code is not the fastest cowboy in the west... but! it's one with lots of friends!

Feel free to explore the repository as you'll find examples of what's properly and what's poorly done. Feel free to comment and add pull requests if you feel like anything might be improved.

# Glossary
- Readability: The quality of a piece of software to be read and understood in a clear way, avoiding forcing the reader to go over and over jumping from one line to another trying to figure what the original developer intended to do.
- Upradability: The quality of a piece of software to have new features added without causing a disturbance in the force, err... without popping the developers head when trying to add new features.
- Mantainability: The quality of a piece of software to have a bug fixed in the most linear possible time without interfering in other features not involved in such bug.
- RUM: Acronym for the last 3 terms
